Machine Learning Final Project on predicting used car sale prediction 

## Problem Statement:
The task of predicting the selling price of used cars is crucial for both sellers and buyers in the automotive market. However, determining an accurate selling price can be challenging due to various factors such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, seller, and fuel. To address this challenge, this project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the selling price of used cars based on their attributes.

## Solution
The proposed solution involves collecting a comprehensive dataset of used cars, including features such as make, model, year, kilometers driven, , Fuel, Transmission and owner.

*Explore the data and learn about it.*

*Data cleaning and Data Visualization.*

*Splitting the data into Train & Test Data.*

*Selecting  and creating a model,in this case linear regression.*

*Training the model and evaluating its performance.*

## Data
The Data set is taken from Kaggel(Vehical Dataset):it is not a large dataset,but for learning purposes,it is was good.It has 300 rows and 9 coloums.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

1. Name
2. Year
3. Selling_price
4. Km_driven
5. Fuel
6. Seller_type
7. Transmission
8. Owner 

Data set most be processed before using it. Some common cleaning includes parsing, converting to data type which is required for our algorithm, removing unnecessary data.Here inthis dataset,there are no missing values and the data is encoded,for example categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.In our case the,the fuel-Typr,Seller_type and Transmisson is encoded into numericals and then splitting the data into training and Test data.
